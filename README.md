# N-Gate
Ironically read the n-gate's latest post, most likely an annotated digest of the top "Hacker" "News" posts

```
PS [rock] [C:] ...\HTTP_Media> python .\ngate.py
webshit weekly
An annotated digest of the top "Hacker" "News" posts for the second week of August, 2021.


[August 08, 2021 | One Bad Apple | https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/929-One-Bad-Apple.html | http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28110159]

An Internet is mad about Apple (business model: "Uber for spyware") turning your phone into a cop, and posts a lot of irrelevant misunderstandings about it.  Hackernews follows this up with dire warnings about the state of child trafficking in the world today, complete with admonishments that there is no hope for improvement, except for venture-backed smartphone apps.
